Matrix Calculator Using C Programming

Abstract:
This microproject explores the implementation of matrix operations—addition, multiplication, and subtraction—using the C programming language. Matrices are fundamental mathematical structures widely used in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science. This project aims to provide an efficient and practical approach to perform these operations through coding, enhancing the understanding of both matrix algebra and programming logic. The project focuses on writing functions to perform element-wise addition, scalar and matrix multiplication, and matrix subtraction. Additionally, the program is designed to handle matrices of varying sizes, ensuring flexibility and adaptability. By using C programming, the project also emphasizes the importance of algorithmic thinking, memory management, and user input handling. The implementation aims to provide a better understanding of the mathematical principles involved in matrix operations while showcasing how programming can be used as a tool to solve complex mathematical problems efficiently.

Introduction:
This project focuses on implementing basic matrix operations addition, subtraction, and multiplication—using the C programming language. Matrices, essential in various fields like computer graphics and engineering, are used to represent data and solve problems efficiently. The project aims to automate these operations by creating functions that handle matrix input, perform arithmetic operations, and display results. Through this, we enhance our understanding of both matrix theory and programming concepts like arrays and loops.

Concept:
in C-Programming we can run basic matrix operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, and others by using various concepts like 2Darrays, functions, loops (nested loop). a matrix is typically represented as a 2D array. A matrix with m rows and n columns can be represented as a 2D array matrix[m][n]. performing operations on matrices involves accessing and manipulating their individual elements.

Conclusion:
In this project, we implemented basic matrix operations in C, including checks for identity, null, and diagonal matrices, as well as matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication. These operations are essential in many fields like linear algebra, data science, and computer graphics. By developing these functions, we gained a deeper understanding of matrix manipulations and how they can be efficiently coded in C. The project also lays the foundation for extending functionality to more advanced operations, like matrix inversion and optimization, as well as handling dynamic matrix sizes.
